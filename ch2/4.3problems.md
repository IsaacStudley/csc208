# Planar Graphs

Problem 14

- Let's assume this is a planar graph, so v-e+f=2 must be true for the graph. This graph has 11 vertices, 20 edges so 11-20+f=2 so f = 11, so this graph has 11 faces. 
- This graph has a girth of 4. Since in a planar graph g*f<=2*e, 4f<=40, f<=10. But f=11, so this cannot be a planar graph.

Problem 15

- Let's assume this is a planar graph, so v-e+f=2 must be true for the graph. This graph has 11 vertices, 25 edges so 11-20+f=2 so f = 11, so this graph has 16 faces.

- This graph now has a girth of 3. Since in a planar graph g*f<=2*e, 3f<=50, f<=16(2/3). And f=16, so we cannot come to the conclustion that this is not a planar graph just from this.

- This graph does contain the prevoius graph as a subgraph, however, and we know that graph is not planar, so we know that this graph is not planar
